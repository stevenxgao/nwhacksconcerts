# Where's it Lit?

NWHacks 2016

Uses Bandsintown API and Google Maps API to plot concert history on a map.

We parsed the JSON files from our api requests and manipulated the latLongs to make something meaningful that we can visualize.

Currently has two visualizations: concert history, concert coverage (with variable radiuses)

This project used Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Ajax, Google Maps API, and Bandsintown API
